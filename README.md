# Experiment-2
## Aim: Study of lists in python
## Theory:
A list in Python is an ordered collection of elements written inside square brackets. It can store different types of data such
as numbers, strings, and even other lists. Lists are mutable, which means their elements can be modified after creation. Each item 
in a list is accessed using an index that starts from zero. Python lists support operations like adding, deleting, and updating elements.
Slicing allows accessing a range of elements from a list. Built-in functions such as 
len(),sum(),max(),min(),insert(),remove(),sorted,append,etc.help in finding the size of a list.Lists can dynamically change their size during execution. 
Iteration over lists is commonly done using loops. Lists are widely used for efficient data storage and manipulation in Python programs.

## Algorithm:
### Average of a list:
1.average = sum(list)/len(list)
### Finding Maximum, Minimum, and Sorting Marks List:
1. Accept marks from the user in the form of a list.
2. Use built-in functions to find the maximum and minimum marks.
3. Sort the list in ascending order.
4. Display the maximum, minimum, and sorted list.
 ### Grocery List Management Program :
1. Create an initial grocery list with predefined items.
2. Allow the user to add new items to the list.
3. Allow the user to remove unwanted items from the list.
4. Display the updated grocery list.

## Result:
Therefore we understand the importance and usuage of lists in python. We also use different commmands on the lists such as finding its length
concatenating two strings, adding its elements,etc.
